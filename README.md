Readme file for MountainRoguelike.

This game was created by Ben Edwards.

The game is hosted on Heroku at: https://mountainroguelike.herokuapp.com/

This was created in an attempt to create a game that generates levels
procedurally, like a rogue-like. With that in mind I deciced to use text for 
graphics to make it look more in line with older games in the genre.

This is an HTML5 game placed inside of a "canvas" element in the main html page.
The Phaser (phaser.io) framework was used to easily place a game inside the 
canvas element, as well as add simple controls and graphics. 

The idea for story in the game is that the player starts out on a snowy 
mountain, finds a way in and ventures deeper into the mountain. Right now that
might not be entirely clear due to attempting to get the main focus of building 
a simple rogue-like finished. 

There are a number of features that I could add in the future.
  - mobile compatibility
  - potential algorithm improvements
  - add more obstacles
  - add health items
  - add keys or other item mechanics
  - make lava (late game water) dangerous

Controls for the game are:
  - Arrow keys: Move player
  - Spacebar: Proceed through menus and pause game
